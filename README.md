# InverseProblem_2D
My research work alongside Dr. Liem at Kansas State University and Trung Truong also of Kansas State University.


This is a journal I worked on, under the advisory of Dr Dinh Liem Nguyen of Kansas State University and alongside of Trung Truong. 

This paper is concerned with the inverse scattering and the transmission eigenvalues for anisotropic periodic layers. For the inverse scattering problem,
we study the Factorization method for shape reconstruction of the periodic layers from near field scattering data. This method provides a fast numerical algorithm
as well as a unique determination for the shape reconstruction of the scatterer. We present a rigorous justification and numerical examples for the factorization method. 
The transmission eigenvalue problem in scattering have recently attracted a lot of attentions. Transmission eigenvalues can be determined from
scattering data and they can provide information about the material parameters of the scatterers. In this paper we formulate the interior transmission eigenvalue
problem and prove the existence of infinitely many transmission eigenvalues for the scattering from anisotropic periodic layers.

A PDF version of our writeup can be fount in the Inverse Scattering.pdf file in this repository.
